		<p>Content in the blog will be managed by adding an xml file into the "content" folder. This will include title, date, and body</p>
		<p>I created a short python script that iterates through the xml files and aggregates their contents into JSON. An Angular $http.get hits the python script (which needs to be in the cgi-bin folder to run) and is returned a JSON object containing the blog entries. These are then read through an ng-repeat where each response's body is bound to a div and displayed for reading</p>
